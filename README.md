## Subscene grabber

Very rough python script to retrieve subtitle file from subscene.com.
It get the zip file, extracts it and renames the file to the video file.

It also waits for user input at the end for self verification of what is the actual subtitle that has been downloaded.

There a registry exec file but it doesn't work. You can do it manually though.
